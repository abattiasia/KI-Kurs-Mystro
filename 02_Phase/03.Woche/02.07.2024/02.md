In Python, when you try to unpack a list into multiple variables, the number of variables on the left side of the assignment must match the number of elements in the list. In your example, you have a list `n1` with 5 elements but are attempting to unpack it into 2 variables, `x` and `y`. This will raise a `ValueError` because the number of variables does not match the number of elements in the list.

If you want to unpack all elements of the list, you need to have an equal number of variables. Here are a few ways you could handle this:

1. **Unpack into exactly 5 variables:**

```python
n1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
a, b, c, d, e = n1
print(a, b, c, d, e)
```

2. **Use one variable to capture the rest using the asterisk (*) operator:**

```python
n1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
x, *y = n1
print(x)  # 10
print(y)  # [20, 30, 40, 50]
```

3. **If you need only the first two elements and ignore the rest:**

```python
n1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
x, y, *rest = n1
print(x)  # 10
print(y)  # 20
print(rest)  # [30, 40, 50]
```

In your specific case, if you try to directly unpack into `x` and `y`:

```python
n1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
x, y = n1  # This will raise a ValueError
```

You will encounter a `ValueError`. To avoid this, use one of the methods above based on what you intend to do with the elements of the list.
